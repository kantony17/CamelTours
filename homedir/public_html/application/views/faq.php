          <h4><a id="q1" href="#q1">How does the tour downloading work?</a></h4>
          <p>Have you ever noticed when you are surfing the web that pages you haveve visited recently or frequently load faster than other pages? What happens is that your browser <i>caches</i> these pages to make them load more quickly. CamelTours does something similar to this, except it explicitly tells the browser which pages it needs to cache (rather than leaving it up to the browser). The result is that it stores the needed pages in a special cache that can be accessed not only quickly but also offline.</p>
          <h4><a id="q2" href="#q2">Where is the tour stored on my device?</a></h4>
          <p>Since your browser is doing the storing, you should be able to find it under your browser settings, probably under the name of "Website Data" or "Browsing Data." It may be located under your browsing history, or it may also have its own section. There will likely be other data stored in there from other sires, but the CamelTours data will be in a single chunk from cameltours.org. You ca not browse the data from there, but you can see how much is stored.</p>
          <h4><a id="q3" href="q3">Can I delete downloaded tours from my device?</a></h4>
          <p>Of course! Under your browser settings, there should be an option to clear cookies and/or data. You can select this to clear all data stored offline, or you can go into advanced settings and specifically delete the CamelTours data.</p>
          <h4><a id="q4" href="#q4">How can I access the downloaded tour content?</a></h4>
          <p>At the site you are visiting, there should be QR codes posted that you can scan to access the content of the tour. In addition, if you go to the map of the tour (there will be a link on the main page of the tour that says "Map"; alternatively, you can click the link that says "Other Stops on this Tour" on the first slide of every node), you will see a list of all the stops on the tour with links to the page of each one.</p>
          <h4><a id="q5" href="#q5">How many tours can I download onto a single device?</a></h4>
          <p>That entirely depends on the browser you are using! Surprisingly, it is actually quite difficult to find any data about how much content browsers will allow you to cache. Most browsers have a "soft" limit (typically around 25 or 50 megabytes) that they allow before explicitly asking you permission to store more data. (If you receive this prompt, be sure to say "yes"!) Complicating the matter is the fact that tours can be of varying sizes: it entirely depends on the size and the amount of media files the tour creators have added to the tour. To ensure maximum efficiency, limit the amount of tours you cache at any given time to one or two.</p>
          <h4><a id="q6" href="#q6">What hardware/software is required to download tours?</a></h4>
          <p>All you need is a "smart" device with a connection to the Internet! You will also want to have a QR code scanner on your device, which you can get for free in the application store on your device.</p>
          <h4><a id="q7" href="#q7">Do I have to download tours to view them?</a></h4>
          <p>Nope! The purpose of downloading the tours is to prevent excessive data usage or slow load times if you are touring a site without WiFi access. But if you have a large data plan on your smartphone, and the location of the tour is not too remote, then you can probably get away without downloading the tour.</p>
          <h4><a id="q8" href="#q8">Who else has access to my account?</a></h4>
          <p>Only you and the CamelTours.org moderator. The moderator will only modify your content if specifically asked by you, the tour creator, or if they feel the tour is harmful.</p>
          <h4><a id="q9" href="#q9">The tour does not begin to download. What should I do?</a></h4>
          <p> If the tour made no download progress whatsoever and you never saw a loading bar, then there is a good chance that your browser is blocking offline caching. Typically, this is because you are either in private browsing mode or disallowing cookies. You will have to switch out of private browsing mode (which you should be able to do right from within your browser) and/or allow cookies from sites you visit or third parties (which you should be able to do from your browser settings). Unless you do this, there is no way to download the tour since your browser will block all attempts made by CamelTours.org.</p>
          <h4><a id="q10" href="#q10">My download stopped partway through. How can I fix this?</a></h4>
          <p>The downloading process may have just been interrupted, in which case you can just refresh the page and it will likely finish downloading. If that does not work, you may have to update your operating system, use a different browser, or download the tour on a faster connection.</p>
          <h4><a id="q11" href="#q11">Why is the tour downloading so slowly?</a></h4>
          <p>Downloading the multimedia content, especially the audio files, can take some time. If it seems extremely slow, however, it is probably the speed of your Internet connection. If possible, try downloading the tour in a location where you have a fast connection, and you should see much better results.</p>
          <h4><a id="q12" href="#q12">How do I shrink images using GIMP?</a></h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Download GIMP <a href="http://www.gimp.org/downloads/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
            <li>After launching GIMP, go to File > Open... and select your image.</li>
            <li>Go to Image > Scale Image... and adjust the width/height using the drop-downs. By default, changing the width will also change the height (and vice versa) so that the aspect ratio is maintained. We recommend setting the larger dimension to 1000px and then having the smaller dimension adjust automatically.</li>
            <li>Go to File > Export As... and export the image as a JPEG, PNG, GIF, or BMP. (You do not have to change any of the settings that GIMP will prompt you with after you click "Export" the first time. Just click "Export" again.) Alternatively, you can overwrite the larger image with your new smaller one using File > Overwrite [image name], but only do this if you have the original file saved somewhere else!</li>
            <li>Upload your image to your node!</li>
          </ol>
          <h4><a id="q13" href="#q13">How do I compress images using Adobe PhotoShop?</a></h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Open your file in PhotoShop.</li>
            <li>File > Save As. Name your file then select "Save."</li>
            <li>A "JPEG Options" window should appear. Alter the "Quality" input box with an integer between 0 and 12 which converts the size of the file to be under 2 MB. After you are done adjusting the quality/size of the file, hit "Okay."</li>
            <li>Congratulations, you have just finished compressing your image to the proper size. Now, all you have to do is upload your image to your node!</li>
            <li>For more information, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZNNoikZOcc" target="_blank">here</a> is a helpful tutorial.</li>

          <h4><a id="q20" href="#q20">How do I convert text files to audio narrations?</a></h4>
          <p>
            If you don’t want to read your tour, type it up and submit a written text document to  <a href="http://www.naturalreaders.com/priceorder.html " target="_blank"> this software </a> which will convert the text to a narration to use as the MP3 file for your node. If the program doesn't recognize a word - i.e. invalid (to make it someone who is handicap) you have to type in inva lid (with the space between the "a" and "l").  Also, you need to spell out years. An example would be that “1810” should be written out in your text document “eighteen-ten”.
